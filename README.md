# Text File Line Trimmer

**Text-File-Line-Trimmer** is a simple Python script designed to format text files by ensuring that each line does not exceed 120 characters in length.

## Features

- Reads the content of a specified text file.
- Formats the content to ensure no line exceeds 120 characters.
- Writes the formatted content back to the same file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Place the script in the directory containing your text file or adjust the path accordingly in the script.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python Text-File-Line-Trimmer.py
```

By default, the script is set to format "textfile.txt". To format a different file, replace the filename in the `format_file()` function call at the end of the script.
